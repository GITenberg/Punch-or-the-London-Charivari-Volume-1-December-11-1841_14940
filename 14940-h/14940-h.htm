<h2>THE PHYSIOLOGY OF THE LONDON MEDICAL STUDENT.</h2>
<h3>11.&mdash;HOW MR. MUFF CONCLUDES HIS EVENING.</h3>
<div class="dropcap"><a href="images/022-01.png"><img src=
"images/022-01.png" alt=
"A fellow forms a letter E with a bag and a string." id="img022-01"
name="img022-01" width="100%" /></a></div>
<p><span class="hide">E</span>ssential as sulphuric acid is to the
ignition of the platinum in an hydropneumatic lamp; so is
half-and-half to the proper illumination of a Medical
Student&rsquo;s faculties. The Royal College of Surgeons may
thunder and the lecturers may threaten, but all to no effect; for,
like the slippers in the Eastern story, however often the pots may
be ordered away from the dissecting-room, somehow or other they
always find their way back again with unflinching pertinacity. All
the world inclined towards beer knows that the current price of a
pot of half-and-half is fivepence, and by this standard the Medical
Student fixes his expenses. He says he has given three pots for a
pair of Berlin gloves, and speaks of a half-crown as a six-pot
piece.</p>
<p>Mr. Muff takes the goodly measure in his hand, and decapitating
its &ldquo;spuma&rdquo; with his pipe, from which he flings it into
Mr. Simpson&rsquo;s face, indulges in a prolonged drain, and
commences his narrative&mdash;most probably in the following
manner:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know we should all have got on very well if Rapp
hadn&rsquo;t been such a fool as to pull away the lanthorns from
the place where they are putting down the wood pavement in the
Strand, and swear he was a watchman. I thought the crusher saw us,
and so I got ready for a bolt, when Manhug said the blocks had no
right to obstruct the footpath; and, shoving down a whole wall of
them into the street, voted for stopping to play at <em>duck</em>
with them. Whilst he was trying how many he could pitch across the
Strand against the shutters opposite, down came the
<em>pewlice</em> and off we cut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a tight squeak for it,&rdquo; interrupts Mr. Rapp;
&ldquo;but I beat them at last, in the dark of the Durham-street
arch. That&rsquo;s a dodge worth being up to when you get into a
row near the Adelphi. Fire away, Muff&mdash;where did you
go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right up a court to Maiden-lane, in the hope of bolting
into the Cider-cellars. But they were all shut up, and the fire out
in the kitchen, so I ran on through a lot of alleys and back-slums,
until I got somewhere in St. Giles&rsquo;s, and here I took a
cab.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you hadn&rsquo;t got an atom of tin when you left
us,&rdquo; says Mr. Manhug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Devil a bit did that signify. You know I only took the
<em>cab</em>&mdash;I&rsquo;d nothing at all to do with the driver;
he was all right in the gin-shop near the stand, I suppose. I got
on the box, and drove about for my own diversion&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t exactly know where; but I couldn&rsquo;t leave the cab,
as there was always a crusher in the way when I stopped. At last I
found myself at the large gate of New Square, Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn,
so I knocked until the porter opened it, and drove in as straight
as I could. When I got to the corner of the square, by No. 7, I
pulled up, and, tumbling off my perch, walked quietly along to the
Portugal-street wicket. Here the other porter let me out, and I
found myself in Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what became of the cab?&rdquo; asks Mr. Jones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I know!&mdash;it was no affair of mine. I dare
say the horse made it right; it didn&rsquo;t matter to him whether
he was standing in St. Giles&rsquo;s or Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, only
the last was the most respectable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that,&rdquo; says Mr. Manhug, refilling
his pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, all the thieves in London live in St.
Giles&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and who live in Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! that&rsquo;s all worn out,&rdquo; continues
Manhug. &ldquo;I got to the College of Surgeons, and had a good
mind to scud some oyster shells through the windows, only there
were several people about&mdash;fellows coming home to chambers,
and the like; so I pattered on until I found myself in Drury-lane,
close to a coffee-shop that was open. There I saw such a jolly
row!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Muff utters this last sentence in the same ecstatic accents
of admiration with which we speak of a lovely woman or a
magnificent view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it about?&rdquo; eagerly demand the rest of the
circle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, just as I got in, a gentleman of a vivacious turn of
mind, who was taking an early breakfast, had shied a soft-boiled
egg at the gas-light, which didn&rsquo;t hit it, of course, but
flew across the tops of the boxes, and broke upon a lady&rsquo;s
head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a mess it must have made?&rdquo; interposes Mr.
Manhug. &ldquo;Coffee-shop eggs are always so very
albuminous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once I found some feathers in one, and a f&oelig;tal
chick,&rdquo; observes Mr. Rapp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knock that down for a good one!&rdquo; says Mr. Jones,
taking the poker and striking three distinct blows on the
mantel-piece, the last of which breaks off the corner. &ldquo;Well,
what did the lady do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Commenced kicking up an extensive shindy, something
between crying, coughing, and abusing, until somebody in a fustian
coat, addressing the assailant, said, &lsquo;he was no gentleman,
whoever he was, to throw eggs at a woman; and that if he&rsquo;d
come out he&rsquo;d pretty soon butter his crumpets on both sides
for him, and give him pepper for nothing.&rsquo; The master of the
coffee shop now came forward and said, &lsquo;he wasn&rsquo;t a
going to have no uproar in his house, which was very respectable,
and always used by the first of company, and if they wanted to
quarrel, they might fight it out in the streets.&rsquo; Whereupon
they all began to barge the master at once,&mdash;one saying
&lsquo;his coffee was all snuff and duckweed,&rsquo; or something
of the kind; whilst the other told him &lsquo;he looked as measly
as a mouldy muffin;&rsquo; and then all of a sudden a lot of
half-pint cups and pewter spoons flew up in the air, and the three
men began an indiscriminate battle all to themselves, in one of the
boxes, &lsquo;fighting quite permiscus,&rsquo; as the lady properly
observed. I think the landlord was worst off though; he got a very
queer wipe across the face from the handle of his own
toasting-fork.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did you do, Muff?&rdquo; asks Mr. Manhug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that was the finishing card of all. I put the gas
out, and was walking off as quietly as could be, when some
policemen who heard the row outside met me at the door, and
wouldn&rsquo;t let me pass. I said I would, and they said I should
not, until we came to scuffling, and then one of them calling to
some more, told them to take me to Bow-street, which they did; but
I made them carry me though. When I got into the office they had
not any especial charge to make against me, and the old bird behind
the partition said I might go about my business; but, as ill luck
would have it, another of the unboiled ones recognised me as one of
the party who had upset the wooden blocks&mdash;he knew me again by
my d&mdash;d Taglioni.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did they do to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marched me across the yard and locked me up; when to my
great consolation in my affliction, I found Simpson, crying and
twisting up his pocket-handkerchief, as if he was wringing it; and
hoping his friends would not hear of his disgrace through the
<em>Times</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a love you are, Simpson!&rdquo; observes Mr. Jones
patronisingly. &ldquo;Why, how the deuce could they, if you gave a
proper name? I hope you called yourself James Edwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Simpson blushes, blows his nose, mutters something about his
card-case and telling an untruth, which excites much merriment; and
Mr. Muff proceeds:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The beak wasn&rsquo;t such a bad fellow after all, when
we went up in the morning. I said I was ashamed to confess we were
both disgracefully intoxicated, and that I would take great care
nothing of the same humiliating nature should occur again;
whereupon we were fined twelve pots each, and I tossed sudden death
with Simpson which should pay both. He lost and paid down the dibs.
We came away, and here we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mirth proceeds, and, ere long, gives place to harmony; and
when the cookery is finished, the bird is speedily converted into
an anatomical preparation,&mdash;albeit her interarticular
cartilages are somewhat tough, and her lateral ligaments apparently
composed of a substance between leather and caoutchouc. As
afternoon advances, the porter of the dissecting-room finds them
performing an incantation dance round Mr. Muff, who, seated on a
stool placed upon two of the tressels, is rattling some halfpence
in a skull, accompanied by Mr. Rapp, who is performing a difficult
concerto on an extempore instrument of his own invention, composed
of the Scotchman&rsquo;s hat, who is still grinding in the Museum,
and the identical thigh-bone that assisted to hang Mr. Muff&rsquo;s
patriarchal old hen!</p>

<h3>SIGNS OF THE TIMES.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;The times are hard,&rdquo; say the knowing ones.
&ldquo;Hard&rdquo; indeed they must be when we find a DOCTOR
advertising for a situation as WET-NURSE. The following appeared in
the <em>Times</em> of Wednesday last, under the head of &ldquo;Want
Places.&rdquo; &ldquo;As wet-nurse, a respectable person. Direct to
DOCTOR P&mdash;&mdash;, C&mdash;&mdash; Common, Surrey.&rdquo; What
next?</p>

<h2>THE &ldquo;PUFF PAPERS.&rdquo;</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>
<h3>The Giant&rsquo;s Stairs.</h3>
<h4>(CONTINUED.)</h4>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re a match
for me any day; and sooner than be shut up again in this dismal
ould box, I&rsquo;ll give you what you ask for my liberty. And the
three best gifts I possess are, this brown cap, which while you
wear it will render you invisible to the fairies, while they are
all visible to you; this box of salve, by rubbing some of which to
your lips, you will have the power of commanding every fairy and
spirit in the world to obey your will; and, lastly, this little
<em>kippeen</em><sup>1</sup><span class="sidenote">1. A little
stick.</span>, which at your word may be transformed into any mode
of conveyance you wish. Besides all this, you shall come with me to
my palace, where all the treasures of the earth shall be at your
disposal. But mind, I give you this caution, that if you ever
permit the brown cap or the <em>kippeen</em> to be out of your
possession for an instant, you&rsquo;ll lose them for ever; and if
you suffer any person to touch your lips while you remain in the
underground kingdom, you will instantly become visible, and your
power over the fairies will be at an end.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; thinks I, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s
nothing so very difficult in <em>that</em>.&rsquo; So having got
the cap, the <em>kippeen</em>, and the box of salve, into my
possession, I opened the box, and out jumped the little fellow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now, Felix,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;touch your lips
with the salve, for we are just at the entrance of my
dominions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did as he desired me, and, <em>Dharra Dhie!</em> if the
little chap wasn&rsquo;t changed into a big black-looking giant,
sitting afore my eyes on a great rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Lord save us!&rsquo; says I to myself,
&lsquo;it&rsquo;s a marcy and a wondher how he ever squeezed
himself into that weeshy box.&rsquo; &lsquo;Why thin, Sir,&rsquo;
says I to him, &lsquo;maybe your honour would have the civilitude
to tell me your name.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;With the greatest of pleasure, Felix,&rsquo; says
he smiling; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m called Mahoon, the Giant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tare an&rsquo; agers! are you though? Well, if I
thought&rsquo;&mdash;but he gave me no time to think; for calling
on me to follow him, he began climbing up the <em>Giant&rsquo;s
Stairs</em> as asy as I&rsquo;d walk up a ladder to the hay-loft.
Well, he was at the top afore you could cry
&lsquo;trapstick,&rsquo; and it wasn&rsquo;t long till I was at the
top too, and there we found a gate opening into the hill, and a
power of lords and ladies waiting to resave Mahoon, who I larned
was their king, and who had been away from his kingdom for twenty
years, by rason of his being shut up in the box by some great
fairy-man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when we got inside the gates, I found myself in a
most beautiful city, where nobody seemed to mind anything but
diversion. The music was the most illigant thing you ever hard in
your born days, and there wasn&rsquo;t one less than forty Munster
pipers playing before King Mahoon and his friends, as they marched
along through great broad streets,&mdash;a thousand times finer
than Great George&rsquo;s-street, in Cork; for, my dears, there was
nothing to be seen but goold, and jewels, and guineas, lying like
sand under our feet. As I had the little brown cap upon my head, I
knew that none of the fairy people could see me, so I walked up
cheek by jowl with King Mahoon himself, who winked at me to keep my
toe in my brogue, which you may be sure I did, and so we kept on
until we came to the king&rsquo;s palace. If other places were
grand, this was ten times grander, for the very sight was fairly
taken out of my eyes with the dazzling light that shone round about
it. In we went into the palace, through two rows of most engaging
and beautiful young ladies; and then King Mahoon took his sate upon
his throne, and put upon his head a crown of goold, stuck all over
with di&rsquo;monds, every one of them bigger than a sheep&rsquo;s
heart. Of coorse there was a dale of compliments past amongst the
lords and ladies till they got tired of them; and then they sat
down to dinner, and, <em>nabocklish!</em> wasn&rsquo;t there rale
givings-out there, with <em>cead mille
phailtagh</em><sup>2</sup><span class="sidenote">2. A hundred
thousand welcomes.</span>. The whiskey was sarved out in tubs and
buckets, for they&rsquo;d scorn to drink ale or porter; and as for
the ating, there was laygions of fat bacon and cabbage for the
sarvants, and a throop of legs of mutton for the king and his
coort. Well, after we had all ate till we could hould no more, the
king called out to clear the flure for a dance. No sooner had he
said the word, than the tables were all whipped away,&mdash;the
pipers began to tune their chaunters. The king&rsquo;s son opened
the ball with a mighty beautiful young crather; but the mirinit I
laid my eyes upon her I knew her at once for a neighbour&rsquo;s
daughter, one Anty Dooley, who had died a few months before, and
who, when she was alive, could beat the whole county round at any
sort of reel, jig, or hornpipe. The music struck up &lsquo;Tatter
Jack Walsh,&rsquo; and maybe it&rsquo;s she that didn&rsquo;t set,
and turn, and <em>thrush</em> the boords, until the young prince
hadn&rsquo;t as much breath left in his body as would blow out a
rushlight, and he was forced to sit down puffing and panting, and
laving his partner standing in the middle of the room. I
couldn&rsquo;t stand that by no means; so jumping upon the flure
with a shilloo, I flung my cap into the air:&mdash;the music
stopped of a sudden, and I then recollected that, by throwing off
the cap, I had become visible, and had lost one of Mahoon&rsquo;s
three gifts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Divil may care! as Punch said when he missed mass;
I&rsquo;ll have my dance out at any rate, so rouse up &lsquo;The
Rakes of Mallow,&rsquo; my beauties. So to it we set; and when the
<em>cailleen</em> was getting tired well becomes myself, but I
threw my arm around her slindher waist and took such a smack of her
sweet lips, that the hall resounded with the report.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Fetch me a glass of the best,&rsquo; says I to a
little fellow who was hopping about with a tray full of all sorts
of dhrink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Fetch it yourself, Felix Donovan. Who&rsquo;s your
sarvant now?&rsquo; says the chap, docking up his chin as impident
as a tinker&rsquo;s dog. I felt my fingers itching to give the
fellow a <em>polthogue</em><sup>3</sup><span class="sidenote">3. A
thump.</span> in the ear; but I thought I might as well keep myself
paceable in a strange place&mdash;so I only gave him a contemptible
look, and turned my back upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Felix jewel!&rsquo; whispered Anty in my ear.
&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve lost your power over the fairies by that
misfortunate kiss&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&rdquo;&rsquo;<em>Diaoul!</em>&mdash;there&rsquo;s two of
Mahoon&rsquo;s gifts gone already,&rsquo; thinks I,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If you&rsquo;ll take my advice,&rsquo; says Anty,
&lsquo;you&rsquo;ll be off out of this as fast as you
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The sorra foot I&rsquo;ll stir out of this,&rsquo;
says I &lsquo;unless you come along with me <em>ma callieen
dhas</em><sup>4</sup><span class="sidenote">4. My pretty
girl.</span>&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you could have seen the deluding look she gave me
as leaning her head upon my shoulder she whispered to me in a voice
sweeter than music of a dream,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Felix dear! I&rsquo;ll go with you all the world
over, and the sooner we take to the road the better. Steal you out
of the door, and I&rsquo;ll follow you in a few minutes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accordingly I sneaked away as quietly as I could; they
were all too busy with their divarsions to mind me&mdash;and at the
door I met Anty with her apron full of goold and diamonds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;where&rsquo;s the
<em>kippeen</em> Mahoon gave you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Here it is safe enough,&rsquo; I answered, pulling
it out of my breeches pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, now tell it to become a
coach-and-four.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did as she desired me&mdash;and in a moment there was a
grand coach and four prancing horses before us. You may be sure we
did not stand admiring very long, but both stepped in, and away we
drove like the wind,&mdash;until we came to a high wall; so high
that it tired me to look to the top of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Step out, now,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;but mind
not to let go your held of the coach, and tell it to change itself
into a ladder.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had my lesson now; the coach became a ladder, reaching
to the top of the wall; so up we mounted, and descended on the
other side by the same means. There was then before us a terrible
dark gulf over which hung such a thick fog that a priest
couldn&rsquo;t see to bless himself in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Call for a winged horse,&rsquo; whispered
Anty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did so, and up came a fine black horse, with a pair of
great wings growing out of his back, and ready bridled and saddled
to our hand. I jumped upon his back, and took Anty up before me;
when, spreading out his wings, he flew&mdash;flew, without ever
stopping until he landed us safe on the opposite shore. We were now
on the banks of a broad river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This,&rsquo; said Anty, &lsquo;is our last
difficulty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The horse was changed into a boat, and away we sailed
with a fair breeze for the opposite shore, which, as we approached,
appeared more beautiful than any country I had ever seen. The shore
was crowded with young people dancing, singing, and beckoning us to
approach. The boat touched the land; I thought all my troubles were
past, and in the joy of my heart I leaped ashore, leaving Anty in
the boat; but no sooner had my foot parted from the gunwale than
the boat shot like an arrow from the bank, and drifted down the
current. I saw my young bride wringing her fair hands, weeping at
if her heart would break, and crying&mdash;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page255" name="page255"></a>[pg
255]</span>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why did you quit the boat so soon, Felix? Alas,
alas! we shall never meet again!&rsquo; and then with a wild and
melancholy scream she vanished from my sight. A dizziness came over
my senses, I fell upon the ground in a dead faint, and when I came
to myself&mdash;I found myself all alone in my boat, with three
tundhering big conger-eels fast upon my lines. And now, neighbours,
you have all my story about the <em>Giant&rsquo;s
Stairs</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>DRAW IT GENTLY.</h3>
<p>Joseph Hume&rsquo;s attention having been drawn to the great
insecurity of letter envelopes, as they are now constructed, has
submitted to the Post-master-General a specimen of a new safety
envelope. He states that the invention is entirely his own, and
that he has applied the principle with extraordinary success in the
case of his own breeches-pocket, from which he defies the most
&ldquo;artful dodger&rdquo; in the world to extract anything. We
can add our testimony to the <em>un-for-giving</em> property of
Joe&rsquo;s monetary receptacle, and we trust that his excellent
plan may be instantly adopted. At present there is immense risk in

<h3>FASHIONABLE MOVEMENTS.</h3>
<p>Yesterday Paddy Green, Esquire, called at &ldquo;The Great
Mogul,&rdquo; where he played two games at bagatelle, and went
&ldquo;Yorkshire&rdquo; for a pot of dog&rsquo;s nose. He smoked a
short pipe home.</p>
<p>On Tuesday Charles Mears, I.M., accompanied by Jeremiah Donovan,
called at the residence of Paddy Green, Esquire, in Vere-street, to
inquire after the health of Master P. Green.</p>
<p>Master James Marc Anthony George Finch has succeeded Bill
Jenkins as errand-boy at the butter-shop in Great Wild-street. This
change had long been expected in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>On Friday Paddy Green, Esquire, did not rise till the evening. A
slight disposition to the prevailing epidemic, influenza, is stated
to be the cause. He drank copiously of rum-and-water with a piece
of butter in it.</p>
<p>On Thursday last the lady of Paddy Green, personally attended to
the laundry; a fortnight&rsquo;s wash took place, when Mrs. Briggs,
the charwoman, was in waiting. Mrs. P. Green, with her accustomed
liberality, sent out for a quartern of gin and a quarter of an
ounce of brown rappee.</p>
<p>Charles Mears, I.M., and Jeremiah Donovan yesterday took a short
walk and a short pipe together.</p>
<p>It is confidently reported that at the close of the present
Covent-Garden season that Mr. Ossian Sniggers will retire from the
stage, of which he has been so long a distinguished ornament. We
have it from the best authority that he purposes going into the
retail coal and tater line.</p>

<h3>PUNCH&rsquo;S LETTER-WRITER.</h3>
<p>DEAR PUNCH! VENERABLE NOSEY!</p>
<p>By the bye, was Publius Ovidius <em>Nuso</em> an ancestor of
yours? Talking of ancestors, why do the Ayrshire folks speak of
theirs as <em>four bears</em> (forbears), it sounds very ursine.
But to our <em>muttons</em>, as my old French master used to call
it. Do you do anything in the classico-historical line, for the
Charivaresque enlightenment of the British public; if so, here is a
specimen of a work in that style, &ldquo;done out of the
original:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<h4>THE DEATH OF C&AElig;SAR:</h4>
<h5>A TOUCH OF THE CLASSICAL IN THE VULGAR TONGUE.</h5>
<p>When he beheld the hand of him he had so loved raised against
him, C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s heart was filled with anguish, and
uttering the deep reproach&mdash;&ldquo;And thou, too,
Brutus!&rdquo; he shrouded his face in his mantle, and fell at the
foot of Pompey&rsquo;s statue, covered with wounds. Thus, in the
zenith of his glory, perished Caius Julius C&aelig;sar, the
conqueror of the world, and the eloquent historian of his own
exploits; spiflicatus est (says my original), he was done for: he
got his gruel, and inserted his pewter in the stucco, B.C. 44.</p>
<p>Perhaps you may not receive the above; but &ldquo;sticking his
spoon in the wall&rdquo; reminds me of a hint I have to offer you.
Did you ever see any Apostle spoons&mdash;old things with saints
carved on their handles, which used to be presented, at
christenings, &amp;c. Now I think you might make your fortune with
His Royal Highness of Cornwall, on the occasion of his christening,
by getting together a set of spoons to present to him; and I would
suggest your selection of the most notorious <em>spoons</em>, such
as the delectable Saddler Knight, Peter Borthwick, Calculating
Joey, <em>the</em> Colonel, Ben D&rsquo;Israeli, &amp;c. You might
even class them, putting Sir Andrew Agnew in as a grave(y) spoon; a
teetotal chief as a <em>tea</em> spoon; Wakley, being a
<em>deserter</em>, as a <em>dessert</em> spoon; D&rsquo;Israeli,
being so amazingly soft, as a <em>pap</em> spoon, &amp;c. &amp;c.
Send them with Punch&rsquo;s dutiful congratulations, and you will
infallibly get knighted; but don&rsquo;t take a baronetcy, my
respectable friend, for I hear that, like my friend Sir Moses, you
are inclined to Judyism (Judaism)<sup>5</sup><span class=
"sidenote">5. Have I &ldquo;seen that line before?&rdquo;</span>.
May the shadow of your nose never be less; and Heaven send that you
may take this up after dinner! Farewell!</p>
<p class="rgt">POLICHINICULUS.</p>

letter after the pleasant discussion of a boiled
chicken.&mdash;<em>Ed. of &ldquo;Punch.&rdquo;</em></p>

<h3>CUPID&rsquo;S BOW.</h3>
<p>SIR JAMES GRAHAM was conversing the other day with
D&rsquo;Israeli on what he designated &ldquo;the <em>crooked</em>
policy of Lord Palmerston.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CERTAINLY NOT &ldquo;BETTER LATE THAN NEVER.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>SIR FIGARO LAURIE was condoling with Hobler on the loss of the
baronetcy by the late Lord Mayor.</p>
<p>Hobler replied that the loss of the title was not by the late
Lord Mayor but by the <em>late</em> Prince of Wales. But, as he
sagely added,</p>

<p>The <em>sleeping-beds</em> which are occupied by the

BEING WELL SUPPLIED WITH WATER AND PAVED WITH ASPHALTE, THE BOTTOMS
HAVING GOOD PALLS, TO ENSURE THEIR DRYNESS AND CLEANLINESS. The

which her Majesty and the prince are accustomed to inspect their

the Sporting Magazine, extracted in the Times of Dec. 3,

<p>&ldquo;I KNOW the lying-in ward; there is but ONE, which is
small: another room is used when required. There are two beds in
the first. The walls, I should say, were clean; but at that time
they could not he cleansed, as it was full of women. The room was
very smoky and uncomfortable; the walls were as clean as they could
be under the circumstances. I have always felt dissatisfied with
the ward, and many times said it was the most uncomfortable place
in the house; it always looked dirty&hellip;.</p>

<h2>ON SNUFF, AND THE DIFFERENT WAYS OF <em>TAKING</em> IT.</h2>
<p>Snuff is a sort of freemasonry amongst those who partake of
it.</p>
<p>Those who do not partake of it cannot possibly understand those
who do. It is just the same as music to the deaf&mdash;dancing to
the lame&mdash;or painting to the blind.</p>
<p>Snuff-takers will assure you that there are as many different
types of snuff-takers as there are different types of women in a
church or in a theatre, or different species of roses in the
flower-bed of an horticulturist.</p>
<p>But the section of snuff-takers has, in common with all social
categories, its apostates, its false brethren.</p>
<p>For as sure as you carry about with you a snuff-box, of copper,
of tortoise-shell, or of horn (the material matters absolutely
nothing), you cannot fail to have met upon your path the man who
carries no snuff-box, and yet is continually taking snuff.</p>
<p>The man who carries no snuff-box is an intimate nuisance&mdash;a
hand-in-hand annoyance&mdash;a sort of authorised Jeremy Diddler to
all snuff-takers.</p>
<p>He meets you everywhere. The first question he puts is not how
&ldquo;you do?&rdquo; he assails you instantly with &ldquo;Have you
such a thing as a pinch of snuff about you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is absolutely as if he said, &ldquo;I have no snuff myself,
but I know <em>you</em> have&mdash;and you cannot refuse me levying
a small contribution upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If it were only <em>one</em> pinch; but it is two&mdash;it is
four&mdash;it is eight; it is all the week&mdash;all the
month&mdash;it is all year round. The man who carries no snuff box
is a regular Captain Macheath&mdash;a licensed Paul
Clifford&mdash;to everyone that does. He meets you on the highway,
and summonses you to stop by demanding &ldquo;Your snuff-box or
your life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A man can easily refuse to his most intimate friend his purse,
or his razor, or his wife, or his horse; but with what decency can
he refuse him&mdash;or to his coolest acquaintance even&mdash;a
pinch of snuff? It is in this that the evil <em>pinches</em>.</p>
<p>The snuff-taker who carries no snuff-box is aware of
this&mdash;and woe to the box into which his fingers gain admission
to levy the pinch his nose distrains upon.</p>
<p>There is no man who has the trick so aptly at his fingers&rsquo;
ends of absorbing so much in one given pinch, as the man who
carries no snuff box. The quantity he takes proves he is not given
to <em>samples</em>.</p>
<p>Properly speaking he is the landlord of all the boxes in the
kingdom. Those who carry snuff-boxes are only his tenants; and hold
them merely by virtue of a <em>rack-rent</em>, under him.</p>
<p>He is a perpetual plunderer&mdash;a petty purloiner&mdash;a
pinching petitioner <em>in forma pauperis</em>&mdash;a contraband
dealer in snuff. However, he is in general noted for his social
qualities. He is affable, mild, harmless, insinuating, yielding,
and submissive. He never fails to compliment you upon your good
looks, and wonders in deep interest where you buy such excellent
snuff. He agrees with you that Sir Peter Laurie is the first
statesman of the day, and flies into the highest ecstacies when he
learns that it is some of George the Fourth&rsquo;s sold-off stock.
He even acknowledges that Universal Suffrage is the only thing that
can save the nation, and affects to be quite astonished that he has
left his box behind him. He will beg to be remembered to your wife,
and leaves you after begging for &ldquo;the favour of another
pinch.&rdquo; Where is the man whose nature would not be
susceptible of a <em>pinch</em> when invoked in the name of his
wife?</p>
<p>Goldsmith recommends a pair of boots, a silver pencil, or a
horse of small value, as an infallible specific for getting rid of
a troublesome guest. He always had the satisfaction to find he
never came back to return them.</p>
<p>But with the man who carries no snuff-box this specific would
lose its infallibility. It would be folly to lend him your
snuff-box, for at this price snuff would lose all its flavour, all
its perfume for him. The best box to give him would be perhaps a
box on the ear.</p>
<p>If he were obliged to buy his own snuff, it would give him no
sensation. The strongest would not make him sneeze, or wring from
the sensibility of his eyes the smallest tribute to its pungency.
He would turn up his nose at it, or, at the best, use it as
sand-dust to receipt his washerwoman&rsquo;s bills with.</p>
<p>These feelings aside, the man who carries no snuff-box is a good
member of society; that is to say, quite as good a one as the man
who does carry a snuff-box. He is in general a good friend (as long
as he has the <em>entr&eacute;e</em> of your box), a good parent, a
good tenant, a good customer, a good voter, a good eater, a good
talker, and especially a good judge of snuff. He knows by one
touch, by one sniff, by one <em>coup d&rsquo;&oelig;il</em>, the
good from the bad, the old from the new, the fragrant from the
filthy, the colour which is natural from the colour which is
coloured. If any one should want to lay in a stock of snuff, let
him take the man who carries no snuff with him: his <em>ipse
dixit</em> may be relied upon with every certainty. He will choose
it as if he were buying it for himself, and in return will never
forget to look upon it as a property he is entitled to fully as
much as you who have paid for it; for, in fact, would you be in
possession of the snuff if he had not chosen it for you?</p>
<p>As for his complaint, it is like hydrophilia; no remedy has as
yet been invented for it; and we can with comfortable consciences
predict that, as long as snuff is taken, and men continue to carry
it about with them in snuff-boxes, they are sure to be subject to
the importunities of the man who carries no snuff box.</p>

<h3>BUFFOON&rsquo;S NATURAL HISTORY.</h3>
<p>SIR EDWARD LYTTON BULWER, who, like Byron, (in this one instance

hands upon the history of the celebrated George Barrington of
picking-pocket notoriety. That worthy, describing the progress he
made for the good of his country, related some strange particulars
of a foreign bird, called the Secretary, or Snake-eater, which Sir
Edward, from his knowledge of the natural history of his friend
John Wilson Croker, declares to be the immediate connecting link
between the English Admiralty Secretary, or
&ldquo;Toad-eater.&rdquo;</p>

<p>[A letter has found its way into our box, which was evidently
intended for the Parisian <em>Courrier des Dames</em>; but as the
month is so far advanced, we are fearful that the communication
will be too late for the purposes of that fashionable journal. We
have therefore with unparalleled liberality inserted it in PUNCH,

remark that the writer adopts the style of our foreign fashionable

<p class="rgt"><em>Rue de Dyotte</em>,<br />
<em>Derri&egrave;re les Slommes &agrave; Saint Gilles</em>.</p>
<p>MON JOVIAL ANCIEN COQ.</p>
<p><em>Les swelles de Londres</em> have now determined upon the
winter fashions, subject only to such modifications as their
wardrobes render imperative, <em>et y vont comme des Briques</em>.
Butchers&rsquo; trays continue to be worn on the shoulders; and
sprats may be found very generally upon the heads of the
<em>poissonni&egrave;res-faggeuses de la Porte de Billing</em>.
Short pipes are much patronised by architects&rsquo; assistants,
and are worn either in the hatband or the side of the mouth, <em>et
point d&rsquo;erreur</em>. A few black eyes have been seen <em>dans
la Rookerie</em>; but these facial ornaments will not be general
until after boxing-day, <em>quand ils le deviendront bien
forts</em>. Highlows and anklejacks<sup>6</sup><span class=
"sidenote">6. For an elaborate description of these elegances, vide
PUNCH.<br />
7. The <em>Fancy</em>, we presume.&mdash;<em>Printer's
Devil</em>.</span> are still patronised by <em>les
imaginaires</em><sup>7</sup> of both sexes, the only alteration in
the fashion being that the highlow is cut a little more on the
instep, and the anklejack has retrograded a trifle towards the
heel, with those <em>qui veulent le couper gras</em>. A great many
muslin caps are seen, frequently with a hole in the crown, through
which the hair protrudes, and gives a <em>tr&egrave;s
&eacute;piceux et soufflet-haut</em> appearance. They are called
<em>les Capoles des Sept-Dialles</em>.</p>
<p>Others have no opening at the top, but two streamers of the same
material as the cap are allowed to play over the shoulders of
<em>les immenses Cartes</em>. The original colour of these
<em>capotes</em> is white; but they are only worn by <em>les
grandes Cigarres</em> when the white has been very much rubbed
off.</p>
<p>Furs are much worn, both by the male and female <em>magnifiques
poussi&egrave;res</em>. The latter usually carry them suspended
from their apron-strings, and appear to give the preference to hare
and rabbit <em>mantelets</em>, though sometimes domestic felines
are denuded for the same purpose, <em>que puisse m&rsquo;aider,
pomme-de-terre</em>. The gentlemen, on the other hand, carry their
furs at the end of a long pole, and towards Saturday-night a great
number <em>de petits pots</em><sup>8</sup><span class="sidenote">8.
Query mugs&mdash;<em>Anglic&egrave;</em>
faces?&mdash;<em>Printer&rsquo;s Devil</em>.</span> may be seen
enveloped in this costly <em>mat&eacute;riel</em>. The fantails of
the <em>chapeaux d&rsquo;Adelphi</em> are spread rather broader
over the shoulders, and are sometimes elevated behind, <em>quand
ils veulent le faire tr&egrave;s souffl&eacute;ment</em>. Pewter
brooches are still in great request, as are also pewter-pots, which
are used in the tap-rooms of some <em>des cribbes

<h3>FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE.</h3>
<p>A juvenile party, among whom we noticed the two Biggses,
attended in Piccadilly to inspect the sewer now being made. One of
the workmen employed threw up a quantity of the soil, intending no
doubt to give an opportunity to the party of inspecting its
properties; but as it hit some of them in the eye, they retreated
rapidly.</p>
<p>The venerable square-keeper in Golden-square took his usual
airing round the railings yesterday, and afterwards partook of the
pleasures of the chase, by pursuing a boy into John-street. He was
attended by his usual <em>suite</em> of children, who cheered him
in his progress, following him as he ran on, and turning back so as
to precede him, when he abandoned the hunt and resumed his
promenade, which he did almost immediately.</p>
<p>Bill Bumpus walked for several hours in the suburbs yesterday.
In order to have the advantage of exercise, he carried a basket on
his head, and was understood to intimate in a loud tone that it
contained sprats, which he distributed to the humbler classes at a
penny a plateful.</p>

<h3>A NEW WINE.</h3>

<h2>LOYALTY AND INSANITY.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Half the day <em>at least</em>&ldquo;&mdash;says the
editor of the <em>Athen&aelig;um</em>&mdash;&ldquo;we are <em>in
fancy</em> at the Palace, taking <em>our turn</em> of loyal watch
by the cradle of the heir-apparent; <em>the rest</em> at our own
firesides, in that mood of <em>cheerful thankfulness</em> which
makes fun and frolic welcome!&rdquo; Half the day, <em>at
least!</em></p>
<p>A stroke of fancy&mdash;especially to a heavy man&mdash;is
sometimes as discomposing as a stroke of paralysis. Our friend of
the <em>Athen&aelig;um</em> is not to be carried away by fancy,
cost free: his imaginative watch at the Palace&mdash;for who can
doubt that for six hours <em>per diem</em> he is in Buckingham
nursery?&mdash;has led him into the perpetration of various
eccentricities which, when we reflect upon the fortune he must have
hoarded, and the innate selfishness of our common nature, may
possibly end in a commission of lunacy. As juries are now-a-days
brought together (especially as Chartists abound), excessive
loyalty may be returned&mdash;confirmed insanity. It is, however,
our duty as good citizens and fellow-journalists to protest, in
advance, against any such verdict; declaring that whatever may be
adduced by the unreflecting persons in daily intercourse with the
editor&mdash;that grave and learned scribe is in the
enjoyment&mdash;of all the sense originally vouchsafed to him. We
know the stories that are in the most unfeeling manner told to the
disadvantage of the learned and inoffensive gentleman; we know
them, and shall not shrink from meeting them.</p>
<p>It is said that for one hour a day &ldquo;at least&rdquo; since
the birth of the Prince the unfortunate gentleman has been
invariably occupied folding and refolding a copy of the
<em>Athen&aelig;um</em>&mdash;now airing it and smoothing it
down&mdash;now unfolding and now folding it up again. Well, What of
this? The truth is, our poor friend has only been &ldquo;taking his
turn,&rdquo; arranging &ldquo;in fancy&rdquo; the diaper of the
royal nursery. That he should have selected a copy of the
<em>Athen&aelig;um</em> as a type of the swaddling cloth bespeaks
in our mind the presence of great judgment. It is madness with very
considerable method.</p>
<p>A printer&rsquo;s devil&mdash;sent either for copy or a
proof&mdash;deposes that our friend seized him, and laying him in
his lap, insisted upon feeding him with his goose-quill, at the
same time dipping that noisome instrument in his ink-bottle. The
said devil declares that with all his experience of the various
qualities of various inks used by gentlemen upon town, he never met
with ink at once so muddy and so sour as the ink of the
<em>Athen&aelig;um</em>. We do not deny the statement of the devil
as to what he calls the assault committed upon him; but the fact
is, the editor was not in his own study, but was &ldquo;taking his
turn&rdquo; at the pap-spoon of the Duke of CORNWALL!</p>
<p>Betty, the editor&rsquo;s housemaid, has given warning,
declaring that she cannot live with any gentleman who insists upon
taking her in his arms, and tossing her up and down as if she was
no more than a baby; at the same time making a chirruping noise
with his mouth, and calling her &ldquo;poppet&rdquo; and
&ldquo;chickabiddy.&rdquo; Well, we allow all this, and boldly ask,
What of it? We grant the &ldquo;poppet;&rdquo; we concede the
&ldquo;chickabiddy;&rdquo; and then sternly inquire if an excess of
loyalty is to impugn the reason of the most ratiocinative editor?
Does not the thing speak for itself? If BETTY were not a fool, she
would know that her master&mdash;good, regular man!&mdash;meant
nothing more than, under the auspices of Mrs. LILLY, to dandle the
Duke of CORNWALL.</p>
<p>A taxgatherer, calling upon the editor for the Queen&rsquo;s
taxes, could get nothing out of our respected friend, but
&ldquo;Ride a cock-horse to Bamberry Cross!&rdquo; If taxgatherers
were not at once the most vindictive and the most stupid of men (it
is said Sir ROBERT has ordered them to be very carnivorous this
Christmas), the fellow would never have called in a broker to alarm
our excellent coadjutor, but would at once have seen that the
genius of the <em>Athen&aelig;um</em> was taking his turn in
Buckingham Palace, singing a nursery <em>canzonetta</em> to the
Duke of CORNWALL!</p>
<p>And is it for these, to us beautiful evidences of an absorbing
loyalty&mdash;of a feeling that is true as truth, for if it was a
mere conventional flame we should take no note of it&mdash;that the
editor of the <em>Athen&aelig;um</em>, a most grave, considerate
gentleman, should be cited to Gray&rsquo;s-inn Coffee-house, and by
an ignorant and unimaginative mob of jurymen voted incapable of
writing reviews upon his own books, or the books of other
people?</p>
<p>The question that we would here open is one of great and social
political importance. There is an end of personal liberty if the
enthusiasm of loyalty is to be visited as madness. For our part, we
have the fullest belief in the avowal of the poor man of the
<em>Athen&aelig;um</em>, that for half a day he is&mdash;in
fancy&mdash;watching the little Prince in Buckingham nursery; and
yet we see that men are deprived of enormous fortunes (we tremble
for the copyright of the <em>Athen&aelig;um</em>) for indulging in
stories, with equal probability on the face of them. For instance,
a few days since WEEKS, a Greenwich pensioner, (being suddenly
rich, the reporters call him <em>Mister</em> WEEKS,) was fobbed out
of 120,000<em>l.</em> for having boasted (among other things) that
he had had children by Queen ELIZABETH (by the way, the virginity
of Royal BETSY has before been questioned)&mdash;that he intended
to marry Queen VICTORIA, and that, in fact, not GEORGE THE THIRD
but WEEKS THE FIRST was the father of Queen CHARLOTTE&rsquo;S
offspring. Now, what is all this, but loyalty <em>in excess</em>?
Is it not precisely the same feeling that takes the editor of the
<em>Athen&aelig;um</em> half of every day from his family,
spellbinding him at the cradle of the Duke of CORNWALL? Cannot our
readers just as easily believe the pensioner as the editor? We
can.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me he was going to marry the Queen&rdquo; (thus
speaks Sir R. DOBSON, chief medical officer of Greenwich Hospital,
of poor WEEKS), &ldquo;and <em>I had him cupped</em> and treated as
an insane patient!&rdquo; Can the editor hope to escape
blood-letting and a shaven head? &ldquo;He told me he was going to
dine to-day at Buckingham Palace.&rdquo; Thus spoke WEEKS.
&ldquo;Half the day at least we are in fancy at the Palace;&rdquo;
thus boasteth the <em>Athen&aelig;um</em>. The pensioner is found
&ldquo;incapable of managing himself or his affairs:&rdquo; the
editor continues to review books and write articles! &ldquo;He
(WEEKS) also said he had once horse-whipped a lion until it became
afraid of him!&rdquo; Where is CARTER&mdash;where VAN AMBURGH, if
not in Bedlam? Lucky, indeed, is it for the editor of the
<em>Athen&aelig;um</em> that his weekly miscellany (wherein he
<em>thinks</em> he sometimes horse-whips lions) is not quite worth
120,000<em>l.</em> Otherwise, certain would be his summons to
Gray&rsquo;s-inn.</p>
<p>We have rejoiced, as beseemed us, at the birth of the little
Prince; it now becomes our grave moral duty to read a lesson of
forbearance to those enthusiastic people who&mdash;especially if
they have money&mdash;may by an excess of the principle of loyalty
put in peril their personal freedom. Let them not take confidence
from the safety enjoyed by the <em>Athen&aelig;um</em>
editor&mdash;the poverty of the press may protect him. If, however,
he and other influential wizards of the broad sheet, succeed in
making loyalty not a rational principle, but a mania&mdash;if, day
by day, and week by week, they insist upon deifying poor infirm
humanity, exalting themselves in their own conceit, in their very
self-abasement&mdash;they may escape an individual accusation in
the general folly. When we are all mad alike&mdash;when we all,
with the editor of the <em>Athen&aelig;um</em>, take our
half-day&rsquo;s watch at the little Prince&rsquo;s
cradle&mdash;when every man and woman throughout the empire believe
themselves making royal pap and airing royal baby-linen&mdash;then,
whatever fortune we may have we may be safe from the fate of poor
WEEKS, the Greenwich pensioner, who, we repeat, is most unjustly
confined for his notions of royalty, seeing that many of our
contemporaries are still left at liberty to write and publish. Poor
dear little PRINCE! if fed and nourished from your cradle upwards
upon such stuff as that pressed upon you since your birth, what
deep, what powerful sympathies will be yours with the natures of
your fellow-men&mdash;what lofty notions of kingly usefulness, and
kingly duty!</p>
<p>It may be that certain writers think they best oppose the
advancing spirit of the time&mdash;questioning as it does the
&ldquo;divinity&rdquo; that hedges the throne&mdash;by adopting the
worse than foolish adulation of a by-gone age. In a silly flippant
book just published&mdash;a thing called <em>Cecil</em>&mdash;the
author speaks of the first appearance of VICTORIA in the House of
Lords. He says&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An unaccountable feeling <em>of trust</em> rose in my
bosom. I speak it not profanely&mdash;[when a writer says this, be
sure of it that, as in the present case, he goes deep as he can in
profanation]&mdash;when I say <em>that the idea of the yet unknown
Saviour</em>, a child among the Doctors of the Temple, occurred
spontaneously to my mind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now this book has been daubed with honey; the writer has been
promised &ldquo;an European reputation&rdquo; (Madame LAFFARGE has
a reputation equally extensive), and he is at this moment to be
found upon drawing-tables, whose owners would scream&mdash;or
affect to scream&mdash;as at an adder, at SHELLEY. Nay,
Shelley&rsquo;s publisher is found guilty of blasphemy in the Court
of Queen&rsquo;s Bench; and that within these few months. We should
like to know Lord Denman&rsquo;s opinions of Mr. BOONE. What would
he say of Queen Victoria being compared to the Redeemer&mdash;of
Lord LONDONDERRY, <em>et hoc genus omne</em>, being &ldquo;Doctors
of the Temple?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A writer in the <em>Almanach des Gourmands</em> says, in praise
of a certain viand, &ldquo;this is a dish to be eaten on your
knees.&rdquo; There are writers who, with, goose-quill in hand,
never approach royalty, but they&mdash;write upon their knees!</p>

<h2>PUNCH&rsquo;S INFORMATION FOR THE PEOPLE.</h2>
<h3>INTERNATIONAL GEOGRAPHY.</h3>
<p>The Fleet is a very peculiar isolated kingdom, bounded on the
north by the wall to the north or north wall; on the south, by the
wall to the south or south wall; on the east, by the wall to the
east or east wall; and on the west, by the wall to the west or west
wall. The manners and habits of the natives are marked with many
extraordinary peculiarities; and some of the local customs are of
an exceedingly interesting character.</p>
<p>The derivation of the word &ldquo;Fleet&rdquo; has caused many
controversies, and we believe is even now involved in much mystery,
and subject to much dispute.</p>
<p>Some commentators have endeavoured to establish an analogy
between the words &ldquo;<em>fleet</em>&rdquo; and
&ldquo;fast,&rdquo; with the view of showing that these being
nearly synonymous terms, &ldquo;the fleet is a corruption from the
fast, or keep <em>fast</em>.&rdquo; Others again contend the origin
to be purely nautical, inasmuch as this country, like the ships in
war time, is mostly peopled with <em>pressed men</em>. While a
third class argue that the name was originally one of warning,
traditionally handed down from father to son by the inhabitants of
the surrounding countries (with whom this land has never been in
high favour), and that the addition of the letter <em>T</em>
renders the phrase perfect, leaving the caution thus,
<em>Flee-it</em>&mdash;now contracted and perverted into the
commonly used term of <em>Fleet</em>.</p>
<p>As we are only the showmen about to exhibit &ldquo;the lions and
the dogs,&rdquo; we merely put forward these deductions, and tell
our readers they are welcome to choose &ldquo;which<em>h</em>ever
they please, <em>h</em>our little dears!&rdquo; while we will at
once proceed to describe the manners and habits of the natives.</p>
<p>One great peculiarity in connexion with this strange people is,
that the inhabitants are, from the first moment of their
appearance, invariably adults; and we can positively assert the
almost incredible fact, that no <em>bon&acirc; fide</em> occupant
of these realms was ever seen in any part of their domain in the
hands of a nurse, enveloped in the long clothes worn by many of the
infants of the surrounding nations. Like the Spartan youths, all
these people undergo a long course of training, and exceed the age
of one-and-twenty before they are deemed worthy of admission into
the ranks of these singular hordes. They have no actual sovereign,
but merely two traditionary beings, to whom they bow with most
abject servility. These imaginary potentates are always alluded to
under the fearful names of &ldquo;John Doe and Richard Roe;&rdquo;
though they are never seen, still their edicts are all-powerful,
their commands extending to the most distant regions, and carrying
captivity and caption-fees wherever they go. These <em>firmans</em>
are entrusted to the charge of a peculiar race of beings, commonly
called officers to the sheriff. There is something exceedingly
interesting in the ceremonious attendant upon the execution of one
of these potent fiats: the manner is as follows. Having received
the orders of &ldquo;John Doe and Richard Roe,&rdquo; they proceed
to the residence of their intended captive, and with consummate
skill, like the Eastern tellers of tales, commence their business
by the repetition of some ingenious story (called in the language
of the captured, <em>lie</em>), wherein the Bumme Bayllyffe (such
is their title) artfully represents himself &ldquo;as a cousin from
the country,&rdquo; an &ldquo;uncle from town,&rdquo; or some near
and dear long expected and anxiously-looked-for
returned-from-abroad friend. Should their endeavours fail in
procuring the desired interview, they frequently have resort to the
following practice. With the right-hand finger and thumb they open
a small aperture in the side of a species of garment, generally
manufactured from drab broadcloth, in which they encase their lower
extremities, and having thrust their hand to the very bottom of the
said opening, they produce a peculiarly musical sound by jingling
various round pieces of white money, which so entrances the
feelings of the domestic with whom they are discoursing, that his
eyes become fixed upon the hand of the operater the moment the
sound ceases and it is withdrawn. The Bumme Bayllyffe then winketh
his right eye, and with great rapidity depositeth a curious-looking
coin, of the value of five shillings, in the hand of the domestic,
who thereupon pointeth with his dexter thumb over his left shoulder
to a small china closet, in which the enemy of John Doe and Richard
Roe is found, his Wellington boots sticking out of the hamper,
under the straw in which the rest of his person is deposited.</p>
<p>The Bumme Bayllyffe having called him loudly by his name,
showeth his writ, steppeth up, and tappeth him once gently upon the
shoulder, whereupon the ceremony is completed, and the future
inmate of the Fleet departeth with the Bumme Bayllyffe.</p>
<p>The first thing that attracts the attention of the captured of
John Doe and Richard Roe is the great care with which the entrance
to his new country is guarded. Four officials of the warden or
minister of the said John and Richard alternately remain in actual
possession of that interesting pass, to each of whom the new-comer
submits his face and figure for actual and earnest inspection, for
the reason that should the said new arrival by any means pass their
boundary, they themselves would suffer much disgrace and obliquy;
having undergone this inspection, he then proceeds to the interior
of these strange domains.</p>
<p>Walls! walls!! walls!!! meet him on every side; and by some
strange manner of judging the new-comer is immediately known as
such.</p>
<p>The costume of the natives differs widely from the usually
sported habiliments of more extended nations; caps worn by small
boys in other climes here decorated the heads of the most venerable
elders, and peculiarly-cut dressing-gowns do duty for the discarded
broadcloth of a Stultz, a Nugee, or a Willis.</p>
<p>The new man&rsquo;s conformity with the various customs of the
inmates is one of the most curious facts on record. We have been
favoured with the following table or scale by which time regulates
the gradual advancement to perfection of a genuine
&ldquo;Fleety&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<p><em>First Week.</em>&mdash;Ring; union-pin; watch; straps; clean
boots; ditto shirt; shave; and light waistcoat.</p>
<p><em>Second Week.</em>&mdash;Slippers in passage; no straps to
boots; rub on toe; dirty hall; fresh dickey; black vest; two
days&rsquo; beard.&mdash;[<em>Exit ring</em>.]</p>
<p><em>Third Week.</em>&mdash;Full-bosomed stock; one bracer;
indication of white chalk on seat of duck trousers; blue striped
shirt; no vest; shooting jacket; small imperial.&mdash;[<em>Exeunt
union-pin and watch.</em>]</p>
<p><em>Fourth Week.</em>&mdash;White collar; blue shirt; slippers
various; boots a little over at heel; incipient moustache; silk
pocket-handkerchief round neck; and a fortnight&rsquo;s splashes on
trousers.</p>
<p><em>Fifth Week.</em>&mdash;Red ochre outline of increased
whiskers, flourishing imperial, and chevaux-de-frise moustache;
dirty shirt; French cap; Jersey over-all; one slipper and a boot;
meerschaum; dressing-gown; and principal seat at the free and
easy.</p>
<p><em>Sixth.</em>&mdash;Everything in the &ldquo;<em>worser</em>
line;&rdquo; called by christian name by their bed-maker; hold
their tongues, in consideration of three weeks&rsquo; arrears, at
four shillings a week; and then <em>all&rsquo;s done</em>, and the
inhabitant is complete.</p>
<hr />
<h3>ELEGANT PHRASES.</h3>
<p>There are people now-a-days who peruse with pleasure the works
of Homer, Juvenal, and other poets and satirists of the old school;
and it is not unlikely that centuries hence persons will be found
turning back to the pages of the writers of the present day
(especially PUNCH), and we rather just imagine they will be not a
little puzzled and flabbergasted to discover the meaning, or wit,
of some of those elegant phrases and figures of speech so generally
used by this enlightened and reformed age! The following brief
elucidation of a few of these may serve for present ignoramuses,
and also for future inquirers.</p>
<p><em>That&rsquo;s the Ticket for Soup.</em>&mdash;Is one of the
commonest, and originated several years ago, we have discovered,
after much study and research, when a portion of the inhabitants of
this wicked lower globe were suffering under a malady, called by
learned and scientific men &ldquo;poverty,&rdquo; and were supplied
by the rich and benevolent with a mixture of hot water, turnips,
and a spice of beef, under the name of soup. There are two kinds of
tickets for soups in existence in London at present&mdash;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Ticket for Turtle Soup, or a ticket to a Lord Mayor&rsquo;s
Feast. It is only necessary to add, these are in much request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Ticket for Mendicity Society Soup. Beggars and such-like
members of society monopolize these tickets; and it has lately been
discovered by a celebrated philanthropist that no respectable
person was ever known to make use of one of them. This is a
remarkable fact, and worthy the attention of the anti-monopolists.
These tickets are bought and sold like merchandise, and their
average value in the market is about one halfpenny.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>How&rsquo;s your Mother.</em>&mdash;This affectionate
inquiry is generally coupled with</p>
<p><em>Has she Sold her Mangle.</em>&mdash;&ldquo;Mangling done
here&rdquo; is an announcement which meets the eye in several
quarters of this metropolis; and when the last census was taken by
the author of the &ldquo;Lights and Shadows of London Life,&rdquo;
the important discovery was made that this branch of business is
commonly carried on by old ladies. The importance (especially to
the landlord) of the answer to this query is at once
perceivable.</p>
<p>We scarcely expect a monument to be raised to PUNCH for these
discoveries; though if we had our deserts&mdash;but <em>verbum
sap</em>.</p>

<p>MY DEAR PUNCH,</p>
<p>I salute you with reverence&mdash;I embrace you with
affection&mdash;I thank you with devout gratitude, for the many
delightful moments I have enjoyed in your society. I regularly read
your &ldquo;London Charivari:&rdquo; it is
magnificent&mdash;superb! What wit&mdash;what
<em>agacerie</em>&mdash;what exquisite badinage is contained in
every line of it! You are the veritable monarch of English humour.
Hail, then, great <em>fun-ambule</em>, PUNCH THE FIRST! Long may
you live, to flourish your invincible baton, and to increase the
number of your laughing subjects. Your &ldquo;Physiology of the
Medical Student&rdquo; has been translated, and the avidity with
which it is read here has suggested to me the idea that sketches of
French character might be equally popular amongst English readers.
With this hope I send yon the commencement of a Physiological and
Pictorial Portrait of &ldquo;THE LOVER.&rdquo; I have chosen him
for my leading character, because his madness will be understood by
the whole world. Love, <em>mon cher ami</em>, is not a local
passion, it grows everywhere like&mdash;but I am anticipating my
subject, which I now commit to your hands.</p>

<h4>WHAT IS LOVE?</h4>
<p>It is easier to answer this question by a thousand instances,
than by one definition, which can comprehend them all. What is
Love? It is anything you please. It is a prism, through which the
eye beholds the same object in various colours; it is a heaven of
bliss, or a hell of torture; a thirst of the heart&mdash;an
appetite which we spiritualize; a pure expansion of the soul, but
which sooner or later becomes metamorphosed into an animal
passion&mdash;a diamond statue with feet of clay. It is a
dream&mdash;a delirium, a desire for danger, and a hope of
conquest; it is that which everyone abjures, and everyone covets;
it is the end, the great end, and the only end of life. Love, in
short, is a tyrannical influence which none can escape; and however
metaphysicians may define the passion, it appears to me that it is
wholly dependent on the mysterious</p>

<p>LAWS OF ATTRACTION.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<h4>A FEW WORDS ABOUT YOUNG LADIES.</h4>
<p>A young lady, I mean one who has but recently thrown aside her
dolls, is a bashful blushing little puppet, who only acts, speaks,
and moves as mama directs. She is a statue of flesh and blood, not
yet animated by the Promethean fire&mdash;a chrysalis, which may
one day become a beautiful butterfly, fluttering on silken wing
amidst a crowd of adorers; but she is yet only a chrysalis, pale
and cold, and wrapped up in a thousand conventional restrictions,
like a mummy in its swathes.</p>
<p>The <em>very</em> young lady is usually prodigiously careful of
her little self: she regards men as her natural enemies. Poor
innocent!&mdash;This absurdity is the fault of her education. They
have made her believe that love is the most abominable, execrable,
infernal thing in existence. They have taught her to lie and to
dissimulate her most innocent emotions. But the time is not far
distant when the natural impulses of her heart will break down the
barriers that hypocrisy has placed around her. Woman was formed to
love: she must obey the imperious law of her being, and will love
the moment her inspirations for the <em>belle passion</em> become
stronger than her reason. I may add, also, that when a young lady
discovers a tendency this way, it may be safely conjectured the
object on which she will bestow her favour is not very distant.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<h4>THE AUTHOR&rsquo;S DIVISION OF HIS SYSTEM.</h4>
<p>It has been a long-established axiom that there is but one great
principle <span class="pagenum"><a id="page263" name=
"page263"></a>[pg 263]</span> of love; but then it assumes various
phases, according to the thousands of circumstances under which it
is exhibited, and which, to speak in the language of philosophy, it
would be impossible to synthetise. Time, place, age, the very
season of the year, the ruling passion, peace or war, education,
the instincts of the heart, the health of the body and the mind (if
it be possible for the latter to be in a sane state when we fall in
love), the buoyancy of youth or the decrepitude of old
age,&mdash;these, and numerous other causes which I cannot at
present enumerate, serve to modify to infinity the form and
character of the sentiment. Thus we do not love at eighteen as we
do at forty, nor in the city as we do in the country, nor in spring
as we do in autumn, nor in the camp as we do in the court; nor does
the ignorant man love like a learned one; the merchant does not
love like the lawyer; nor does the latter love like the doctor. It
is upon these different phases in the character of love that I have
founded my system. Next week I shall endeavour to describe some of
the traits which distinguish &ldquo;The Lover.&rdquo; Till then,
fair readers,&mdash;I remain your devoted slave.</p>

<h2>GRANT&rsquo;S MEDITATIONS AMONG THE COFFEE-CUPS.</h2>
<p>We had long considered ourselves the funniest dogs in
Christendee; and, in the plenitude of our vanity, imagined that we
monopolised the attention and admiration of the present and the
future. We expected to be deified, and thus become the founders of
a new mythology. PUNCH must be immortal! But how shorn of his
pristine splendour&mdash;how denuded of his fancied glories! for
the <em>John Bull</em> has discovered&mdash;</p>
<h3>GRANT&rsquo;S LIGHTS AND SHADOWS OF LONDON LIFE.</h3>
<p>Wretched as we must be at this reflection, we generously resort
to&mdash;our scissors, and publish our own discomfiture.</p>
<p>In alluding to the author&rsquo;s description of the London
dining-room, the <em>John Bull</em> remarks:&mdash;</p>
<p>It will bring comfort to the savage bosoms of the late Ministry,
for whose especial information we must make a few more extracts,
concerning coffee-houses, or shops, as they are mostly termed.</p>
<h4>COFFEE SHOPS.</h4>
<p>The second class of coffee-houses, and those I have particularly
in my eye, are altogether different from those I have just
mentioned. The prices are remarkably moderate in most of these
places; the charge is no more than three-halfpence for half a pint
of coffee, or <em>threepence for a whole pint</em>. The price of
half a pint of tea is twopence, <em>of a whole pint fourpence</em>.
If you simply ask bread to your tea or coffee, two large slices,
well buttered, are brought you, for which you are charged twopence.
Or should you prefer having a penny roll, or any other sort of
bread, you can have it at the same price as at the
baker&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>In most coffee-houses, you may also have chops or steaks for
dinner. If the party be a <em>rigid economist(!)</em> he may, as
regards some of these <em>establishments</em>, purchase his steak
or chop himself, and it will be prepared gratuitously for him; but
if that be too much trouble for him to take, and he prefers
ordering it at once, he will get, in many houses, his chop with
bread and potatoes with it for sixpence, and his steak for
ninepence or tenpence.</p>
<p>These coffee-houses have many advantages over hotels, besides
the great difference in the prices charged. In the first place,
there is not so much <em>formality</em> or <em>affected
dignity</em> about them, and they are far better provided with
means of rational amusement; and the promptitude with which a
customer is served is really surprising.</p>
<p>Are not these passages declarations of the individual? Winding
himself up with twopenny-worth of cheese! Pleading for the
additional penny for the waitress, whose personal charms and
obliging disposition must be considered to extort the amount! And
above all, unable to conceive any motive, except aversion to
trouble, for disliking to carry &ldquo;his chop&rdquo; upon a
skewer through the streets of London. How every line revels in the
recollection of having dined, and speaks how seldom! while the
<em>well-buttered</em> bread infers the usual fare. Still it is not
meanly written. There are a glorying and exultation in every word
that redeem it, and show the author is more to be envied than
compassionated; though a little further on we perceive the shifts
to which his homeless state has reduced him.</p>
<h4>MEDITATION IN LONDON.</h4>
<p>You can order, if you please, a cup of coffee without anything
to it; and, for so doing, you may sit if you wish for five or six
hours in succession.</p>
<p>I have said that coffee-houses are excellent places for reading;
I might have added, for <em>meditation</em> also. For unlike
public-houses, there are no noisy discussions and disputes in them.
All is calm, tranquil, and comfortable. The beverage, too, which is
drank as a beverage, as I before remarked in a previous chapter,
<em>cheers, but not inebriates</em>.</p>
<p>The remarks are generally equally original, and the facts, no
doubt in some degree truths, are all alike humorous; the more so
when the aspect of the book and the names of the respectable
publishers suggest the higher class of readers to whom it is
addressed. Little anecdotes are interspersed, concerning Harriet,
of Coventry-street, who didn&rsquo;t mind her stops; and James,
behind the Mansion-house, who knew everybody&rsquo;s appetite, that
enliven the descriptive portions of the work, which is in its very
inappropriateness the more amusing, and cannot be read without
reaping both information and instruction on topics which no other
author would have had the temerity to discuss.</p>
<p>But these are only words. Let PUNCH, the rival of this
Caledonian Asmodeus, do justice to the man whose &ldquo;character
is stamped on every page (of his own), who yet is above pity; poor,
yet full of enjoyment; humble, yet glorious; ignorant, yet
confident.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>THE MONEY MARKET.</h3>
<p>Tin is 14 per cwt. in London, and this, allowing a fraction for
wear and tear, gives an exchange of 94 36-27ths in favour of
Hamburgh.</p>
<p>The money market is much easier this week, and bills
(play-bills) were to be had in large quantities. A large capitalist
who holds turnpike tickets to a large amount, caused much confusion
by letting some pass from his hands, when they flew about with
alarming rapidity. Several persons seemed desirous of taking them
up, but a rush of bulls (from Smithfield) rendered this quite
impossible.</p>
<p>Whitechapel scrip was done at 000 <em>premium</em>; but in the
course of the day 00000 discount was freely offered.</p>
<p>This was settling day, when many parties paid the scores they
had been running at the cook-shop opposite. There was only one
defaulter, and as it was not anticipated he would come up to the
mark; for he had been chalking up rather largely of late: nothing
was said about it.</p>

<h3>A DICTIONARY FOR THE LADIES.</h3>
<h4>PUNCH,</h4>
<p>Solicitous to maintain and enhance that reputation for gallantry
towards his fair readers which it has ever been his pride to have
merited, has much pleasure, not unmixed with self-congratulation,
in thus announcing to the loveliest portion of the creation the
immediate appearance of</p>
<h4>A DICTIONARY ENTIRELY AND EXCLUSIVELY FOR THEIR USE;</h4>
<p>in which the signification of every word will he given in a
strictly feminine sense, and the orthography, as a point of which
ladies like to be properly independent, will be studiously
suppressed. The whole to be compiled and edited by</p>
<h4>MADAME PUNCH.</h4>
<p>To which will be appended a little Manual addressed
confidentially by PUNCH himself to the Ladies, and entitled</p>
<h4>TEN MINUTES&rsquo; ADVICE ON THE CARE AND USE OF A
HUSBAND;</h4>
<p>or &ldquo;what to ask, and how to insist upon it, so that the
obstreperous bridegroom may become a meek and humble
husband.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>SPECIMEN OF THE WORK.</h4>
<p><em>Husband</em>.&mdash;A person who writes cheques, and dresses
as his wife directs.</p>
<p><em>Duck</em>, <em>in ornithology</em>.&mdash;A trussed
bridegroom, with his giblets under his arm.</p>
<p><em>Brute</em>.&mdash;A domestic endearment for a husband.</p>
<p><em>Marriage</em>.&mdash;The only habit to which women are
constant.</p>
<p><em>Lover</em>.&mdash;Any young man but a brother-in-law.</p>
<p><em>Clergyman</em>.&mdash;One alternative of a lover.</p>
<p><em>Brother</em>.&mdash;The other alternative.</p>
<p><em>Honeymoon</em>.&mdash;A wife&rsquo;s opportunity.</p>
<p><em>Horrid</em>; <em>Hideous</em>.&mdash;Terms of admiration
elicited by the sight of a lovely face anywhere but in the
looking-glass.</p>
<p><em>Nice</em>; <em>Dear</em>.&mdash;Expressions of delight at
anything, from a baby to a barrel-organ.</p>
<p><em>Appetite</em>.&mdash;A monstrous abortion, which is stifled
in the kitchen, that it may not exist during dinner.</p>
<p><em>Wrinkle</em>.&mdash;The first thing one lady sees in
another&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p><em>Time</em>.&mdash;What any lady remarks in a watch, but what
none detect in the gross.</p>

<h3>SOUP, A LA JULIEN.</h3>
<p>A correspondent of the <em>Sunday Times</em> proposes to raise
ten thousand for the benefit of the labouring classes, in the
following manner:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon a <em>prima facie</em> view, my suggestion may
appear impracticable, but I am sure the above amount could be
raised for the benefit of the labouring classes by one effort of
royalty&mdash;an effort that would make our valued Queen
invaluable, and, at the same time, afford the Ministry an
opportunity of making themselves popular in the cause of their
country&rsquo;s good. Westminster Hall is acknowledged to be the
largest room in the empire, and, with very little expense, might be
fitted up with a temporary throne, &amp;c., for promenade concerts,
for one, two, or three, days. All the vocal and instrumental talent
of the day would be obtained gratis, and Her Most Gracious
Majesty&rsquo;s presence, for only two hours on each day, with the
admission tickets at one guinea, would produce more money than I
have mentioned.&rdquo; Would the above amiable philanthropist
favour us with his likeness? We imagine it would be a splendid</p>

<h3>POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE.</h3>
<p>SIR ROBERT PEEL was observed to put a penny into the hands of
the man at the crossing in Downing-street. It is anticipated, from
this trifling circumstance, that <em>sweeping</em> measures will be
introduced on the assembling of Parliament.</p>
<p>A deputation from the marrow-bones and cleavers waited on Lord
Stanley at the Treasury. His lordship listened attentively for some
minutes, and then abruptly left the apartment in which he had been
sitting.</p>
<p>We understand that Colonel Sibthorp intends proposing an
economical plan of church extension, that is to cost nothing to the
public; for it suggests that churches should be built of Indian
rubber, by which their extension would become a matter of the
greatest facility.</p>
<p>It is rumoured that the deficiency in the revenue is to be made
up by a tax on the incomes of literary men; and a per-centage on
the profits of <em>Martinuzzi</em> will first be levied by way of
experiment. Should it succeed, a duty will be laid on the produce
of <em>The Cloak and the Bonnet.</em></p>
<hr />
<h3>THE LATE PROMOTIONS.</h3>
<p>The whole of the police force take one step forward, on account
of the late very liberal brevet.</p>
<p>Sergeant Snooks, of the Royal Heavy Highlows, to be raised to
the Light Wellingtons.</p>
<p>Policemen K 482,611, to be restored to the staff by having his
staff restored to him, which had been taken from him for
misconduct.</p>
<p>Corporal Smuggins, 16th Foot, to be Sergeant by purchase,
<em>vice</em> Buggins, arrested for debt.</p>
<p>All the <em>post</em> captains, who were formerly Twopennies,
will take the rank of Generals.</p>
<p>In the Thames Navy, 2d mate Simpkins, of the <em>Bachelor</em>,
to be 1st mate, <em>vice</em> Phunker, fallen overboard and
resigned.</p>
<p>All the men who are above the age of 100, and are in the actual
discharge of duty as policemen, are to be immediately superannuated
on half-pay&mdash;a liberal arrangement, prompted, it is believed,
by the birth of the Prince of Wales.</p>
<hr />
<h3>PUNCH&rsquo;S THEATRE.</h3>
<h4>NORMA, OSSIAN, AND PAUL BEDFORD.</h4>
<p>A vestal virgin with a husband and two children, a Roman
Lothario, with an Irish friend, a Druidical temple, a gong, and an
<em>auto-da-f&eacute;</em>, mix up charmingly with Bellini&rsquo;s
quadrille-like music to form a pathetic opera; and sympathetic
<em>dilettanti</em> weep over the woes of &ldquo;Norma,&rdquo;
because they are so exquisitely portrayed by Miss Kemble, in spite
of the subject and the music. Such, indeed, is the power of this
lady&rsquo;s genius&mdash;which is shed like a halo over the whole
opera&mdash;that nobody laughs at the broad Irish in which
<em>Flavius</em> delivers himself and his recitative; few are
risibly affected by the apathetic, and often out-of-tune, roarings
of <em>Pollio</em>:&mdash;than which stronger testimony could not
be cited of the triumph of Miss Kemble; for solely by her influence
do those who go to Covent-Garden to grin, return delighted.</p>
<p>But Apollo himself could not charm away the rich fun that
pervades the English adaptation; nor the modest humour of its
preface. It has been, hitherto, one characteristic of the lyric
drama to consist of verse; rhyme has been thought not wholly
dispensable. Those, however, who are &ldquo;familiar with the
writings of Ossian,&rdquo; (and the works of the Covent-Garden
adapter), will, according to the preface, at once see the fallacy
of this. Rhyme is mere &ldquo;jingle,&rdquo;&mdash;rhythm,
rhodomontade,&mdash;metre, monstrous,&mdash;versification,
villanous,&mdash;in short, Ossian did not write poetry, neither
does this learned prefacier&mdash;so it&rsquo;s all nonsense!</p>
<p>To burlesque such a work as &ldquo;Norma,&rdquo; then, is to
paint the lily, to gild refined gold, to caricature Lord Morpeth,
or to attempt to improve PUNCH. Yet the opportunity was too
tempting to be wholly overlooked, and a hint having been dropped in
one of our &ldquo;Pencillings,&rdquo; an Adelphi scribe has acted
upon it. An enlarged edition of the work may, therefore, now be had
at half-price. A heroine of six foot two or three in her sandals,
with a bass voice, covers the stage with tremendous strides, and
warbles out &ldquo;her wood-notes&rdquo; (being a Druidess she
worships the <em>oak</em>) &ldquo;wild,&rdquo; with a volume of
voice which silences the trombone, and makes the ophecleide sound
asthmatic. In short, the great feature is Mr. Paul Bedford. The
children he brings forward are worthy of their parentage.
<em>Pollio</em> is made a most killing Roman <em>rou&eacute;</em>
by Mrs. Grattan; but <em>Norma&rsquo;s</em> attendant does not
speak Irish half so richly as the Covent-Garden
<em>Flavius</em>.</p>
<p>But, above all, commend we Mr. Wright&rsquo;s
<em>Adelgeisa</em>. It is a masterpiece; all the airs and graces of
the <em>prima donna</em> he imitates with a true spirit of
burlesque. As to his singing, it astonished everybody, and so did
the introduction of &ldquo;All round my Hat,&rdquo;&mdash;a most
unnecessary interpolation, for the original music is quite as
droll.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
